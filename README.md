# Image to Link Conversion 

Upload an image of your own, image is then converted into a link.

## Purpose

I made this application because I read that storing an image to MongoDB, or any database is bad because of the large 
file size compared to text and other file types. Storing an image link to a database is better for keeping file sizes 
low. 

## Stack Used
- MongoDB
- Express.js
- React.js
- Node.js
- Cloudinary
